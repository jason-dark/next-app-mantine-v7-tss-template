## About

This template is a minimal demonstration of [Mantine V7](https://mantine.dev/about/) in a [Nextjs 14 app dir](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) project, using [TSS](https://docs.tss-react.dev/api/tss-usestyles) for styling. This enables you to use Mantine V7 with CSS-in-JS.

It's worth noting that you can extend TSS much further than what is demonstrated here. You could create your own custom instance of `useStyles` as demonstrated in the standalone example [here](https://docs.tss-react.dev/), then pass your Mantine theme, as well as other related helper functions, directly into it.
